# LightHl7Library

The LightHl7Library from nule.org.

This is a minimal HL7 library for parsing, processing, and producing HL7 v2 documents (and documents that look similar) for Java. I wrote these years and years ago, and they still get regular use, but I don't have much interest in maintaining the original website where I hosted them. So github, here you go!

I still do support these utilities, and welcome PRs for fixes and functionality, just open an issue to discuss them first.
